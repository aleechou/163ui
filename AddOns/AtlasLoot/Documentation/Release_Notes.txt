Naxx Update
Updates for all localisations except Korean

NOTE: RIGHT CLICK QUERY USAGE
All you need to do is right click an item.  If it is in your local cache already,
you will just see a note saying the item is safe.  If the item needs to be fetched
from the server, you will see a message to that effect.  Keep right clicking until
that message goes away.

If you have right clicked on an item that has not dropped on your server (or in your
battlegroup) you will either be disconnected or the 'querying server' message will
not go away no matter how many time you click.

NOTE: NOT A BUG
The introduction of cross server battlegrounds has brought some interesting
challenges as far as loot linking goes.  In many cases, you can get the tooltip
for an item as someone in your battlegroup has it, but you cannot link it in a
chat channel as it has not dropped on your server.  As a result, I can no longer
guarantee safe item linking, only safe viewing of tooltip data
