Added Debug code for people experiencing missing pets.

Procedure: Cut and paste /run PetJournalEnhanced:Debug("albino snack") into your chat box and change "albino snack" to the missing pet (remember to include qoutes around the name).

examples:
/run PetJournalEnhanced:Debug("albino snack")

This Should always fail as their is no pet named albino snack

/run PetJournalEnhanced:Debug("yellow moth")

This should succeed in finding the yellow moth in the sorted data (it will choose the owned one over the unowned one)

to find a particular pet use /run PetJournalEnhanced:Debug("") put the pets name (its case insensitive) between the qoute markings. spelling and punctuation matter, do not use a spell link.

If the search fails, take a screen shot of the outputed text and a screenshot of the pet in your journal and selected with PJE disabled.
