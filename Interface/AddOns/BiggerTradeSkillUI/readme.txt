This World of Warcraft addon resizes the Tradeskill UI to the same size of the spellbook. 
This gives more space to have easier access to the filters and a have a longer list.

Has support for:
- Auctionator
- Aurora
- ElvUI

Works with most tradeskill addons (that work with the default Blizzard UI) like:
- TradeTabs
- Overachiever
