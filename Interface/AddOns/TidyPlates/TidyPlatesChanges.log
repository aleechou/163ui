(You may have noticed that I jumped over version 6.14.  I've been so busy, and 6.14 had so many more things to finish, that I felt it best to simply update 6.13 to WoD compatibility, and continue with 6.14 as 6.16)

6.15.0
---------------------------
* TOC update to 60000
* WoD Update....
	* Fixed Target selection issue; UnitExists() now returns true/false, rather than 1/0
	* Fixed Mouseover issue; 6.0 no longer uses the Highlight region to indicate mouseover; Using Name text color change.
	* Fixed Elite/Dragon Texture being reshown; Using :SetAlpha(0) rather than nilling the texture.

6.13.1
---------------------------

* Widgets: Fixed the Class Icon widget. Finally.  Added class-colored borders to each icon.
* Hub: Added a new checkbox to "Scale"; "Auto-Scale Mini Mobs", which will downscale those tiny guys, ironically making it easier to target.

* Hub: "Use Blizzard font" should work properly again.
* Hub: Moved "Health Bar" to the top of the Hub page
* Hub: Merged "Style" into "Headline Mode"
* Hub: Raised "Buffs & Debuffs" upward in the Hub page
* Hub: "Health Bar" gets a couple new choices; Namely, separate coloring options for Friendly vs Enemy plates.

* Core: Added: unit.isMini = boolean.  This will eventually replace "unit.platetype" and "unit.isTrivial". Not anytime soon, though.
* Quatre & Neon: Increased the text size by 1pt to reduce specific scaling concerns.


6.13.Beta2
---------------------------
* Removed the "Unit Spotlight" system, for the moment.  Don't worry- It will come back to the beta release!  I just need to get a solid release done to fix some issues.  Thanks for your patience :-)
* Replaced "Accidental Presidency" with "Roboto Condensed" for Quatre.
* Hub: "Use Blizzard font" should work properly again.

* Added an option to "Spell Casting", "Enable Friendly Castbars"
* New Font: Started replacing "Accidental Presidency" with "Roboto Condensed" across the bundled themes.  Looks similar, but contains more complete character sets; Important for non-English languages.



6.12.6
---------------------------
- Widgets: Combo Point: Anticipation "fix"
- Hub: Cached class colors in instances

6.12.5
---------------------------
- Widgets: Unit Cache: Stores non-local units with a " (*)" suffix.
- Hub: Class colors on cached units shoud work properly

6.12.4
---------------------------
- Core: New unit data: unit.rawName, strips the (*) from nameplate names.
- Core: The carrier frame is now globally labeled with a unique frame name.
- Hub: Healer Tracking: Now uses unit.rawName rather than unit.name
- Widgets: Aura Tracker: Now uses unit.rawName to associate on-screen PvP names
- Widgets: Unit Cache: Will now properly filter non-realm units (ex. coalesced or battlegroup)

6.12.2/3
---------------------------
- Revert fix for viewport mod interaction.  Needs a bit more external testing, apparently.

6.12.1
---------------------------
- TOC Bump
- Core: OnShowCastbar will now check for unit health before proceeding, hopefully avoiding errors when the Castbar's OnShow handler is called early.
- * Fix for Viewport Mods (specifically, Sunn), particularly, when the actual vertical viewport is decreased.

6.12.0
---------------------------
- Core: Compatibility Mode: Restored alpha-override behavior
- Hub: Warning Glow: Fixed InCombatLockdown() reference

6.12.Beta4
---------------------------
- I may have fixed some bugs.  Or maybe that was a dream.  Hard to recall whilst under Benadryl's spell.
- Ok, I definitely changed some things, and I'm not getting errors in game.  That's a good sign.
- Made some changes to (hopefully) fix 1) debuff tracking oddities, and 2) lua error using health text.

6.12.Beta3
---------------------------
- Added a workaround/fix to the broken Blizzard function, InterfaceOptionsFrame_OpenToCategory.  Slash command shortcuts for /hub and /tidyplates will now work properly.
- Added a Compatibility Mode checkbox to the interface panel.  This will fall back to older anchoring methods.
- Core: The OnShow handler will skip all data gather on that first cycle; The Alpha data is (still) unreliable, causing GUID association issues.

6.12.Beta2
---------------------------
- Updated 6.12 with the changes made to the castbar during 6.11.  (Since 6.12 inherits the 6.10 core, it didn't see the progression)
- Aura Widget: Fixed issue where aura is briefly shown, then hidden.  Should be fixed.
- Added a copy of the reference to healthbar and castbar. for Threat Plates Compatibility.

6.12.Beta1
---------------------------
- Reintegration of 6.10 Core, which includes reorganization and rebuilding of the main engine.

6.11.3
---------------------------
- Check unit.health on spell cast functions, to catch premature update calls.

6.11.2
---------------------------
- In reverting, I missed updating the TOC version for TidyPlatesHub.  Updated for 50300

6.11.1
---------------------------
- Core: Fixed a cast bar bug, where the sub-object references were not being updated.  Addresses certain "attempt to perform arithmetic on field 'health' (a nil value)" errors

6.11
---------------------------
- Basically, I've given up trying to quickly patch up 6.10.  I've reverted to 6.9.9, and made the changes necessary for it to work with WoW 5.3.  If you want the Performance Mode stuff, grab the old version, or keep an eye out for it to be Re-Beta'd as 6.12.

These are the changes that I've migrated:
- Spell Casting Update, for WoW 5.3
- Core: Set initial fonts during Init/Hooking.  Removes the possibility of :SetFont() errors.
- Combo Points: "Antic ipation" fix for non-english regions


6.10.4
---------------------------
- Core: Fixed a major typo. Should fix SetStyle/Headline Mode and ClassIcon LUA errors at the very least.  Might explain some of the other elusive bugs.

6.10.3
---------------------------
* Performance Mode:
By default this is NOT enabled, reverting to the older, slower, reliable method.
Using Performance Mode may break HHTD and other nameplate addons.
You may also experience 'hung' nameplates.  Please report these, and try to be as
specific as possible in describing the condition of the game when it occured.

- Core: (Since 6.10.2) Performance Mode:  This enables the performance improvements introduced in 6.10.
- Core: Reintegrated original Alpha locking
- Core: More reorganization, pruning of old, dead methods
- Core: Set initial fonts during Init/Hooking.  Removes the possibility of :SetFont() errors.  Not sure why I didn't do this years ago.
- Panel: Removal of latent "Show Minimap Icon" button code

6.10.2
---------------------------
- Panel: New Option: Performance Mode.  This enables the performance improvements introduced in 6.10.  By default this is NOT enabled.
- Using "Performance Mode" may cause problems with other nameplate addons.

6.10.1
---------------------------
- Panel: Reverted the dropdown menu init changes from beta4.  Seems to be messing up the panel.
- Core: Blizz Spell Shadow: More thoroughly hidden
- Hub: Threat/Warning Glow fix
- Core: Spelltext; "Font Not Set" error - Hopefully fixed


6.10
---------------------------
Beta 6:
- Reorganized event handling structure to rigorously check the visibility of the parent nameplate to prevent showing previously hidden nameplates or hiding previously shown nameplates

Beta5
- Combo Points: "Anticipation" fix for non-english regions?  need to test
- Core: Back to hooking the base plate.
- Healertrack: Strsplit fix  (thought I fixed that several months ago.. hmmm...)

Beta4
- Refactored a bit of the Core
- Panel: Dropdown menu will now init when the interface panel is shown, rather than on load
- other stuff.  too tired to remember.



- Reparent Tidy Plates Frames to UIParent, Reanchor back to base nameplate = Performance boost.  Sweet.

6.9.9
---------------------------
- Hub: Added "Selective Optional Text"
- Deprecated: 'customart' Texture and theme functions.  Please use the Widget system to create additional textures. (Removing unused textures provides a small performance improvement)
- Core: Reorganized the nameplate strata, removing an unnecessary anchor frame
- Core: Reorganized and relabeled some internal functions, adding a few extra comments
- Core & Aura Widget: Made some changes to reduce extraneous calls.
- Aura Widget: "Show Dispellable Auras" should work, now.  Ran some BGs, and things seemed to work.
- Hub: Added a warning, notifying the user when they're not using a Hub-compatible theme.
- Hub: Added a divider line between Headings
- Aura Widget: The old method of applying the aura widget has been re-added; The new method (described somewhere below) is still preferred!
- Hub: Added "Enable External Widgets" checkbox, to control the running of the Global widget functions described in 6.9.6  *

6.9.8
---------------------------
- Hub: "By Threat" Color Modes will pass through enemy class colors, when available, and then use Reaction colors.  (NPC-Pets will continue to use the "By Threat" colors)
- Hub: "By Threat" Warning Glow Mode now incorporates "By Enemy Healer", so it can be used for Pvp without changing config.
* These changes may evolve into more situationally reactive configs... we'll see!
- Widgets: HealerTrack: Should more reliably and quickly detect the spec of the enemy units.

6.9.7
---------------------------
- Fixed Tank Aura Watcher issue

6.9.6
---------------------------
- Performance improvement on Hidden mobs
- Aura Widget: Better association of Player characters, especially for friendly Buffs
- More extensive 'nil' strsplit error checking
- Hub: Added "Reaction" and "Spell Casting" color options
- Hub: Added reaction colors to 'By Threat' Functions
- Hub: The Widget creation and update functions will look for, and call: TidyPlatesGlobal_OnInitialize, TidyPlatesGlobal_OnContextUpdate, TidyPlatesGlobal_OnUpdate.
	TidyPlatesGlobal_OnInitialize() is called when a nameplate is created or re-shown
	TidyPlatesGlobal_OnContextUpdate() is called when a unit is targeted or moused-over.  (Any time the unitid or GUID changes)
	TidyPlatesGlobal_OnUpdate() is called when other data about the unit changes, or is requested by an external controller.
	* These functions can be used to create and maintain non-theme widgets.  Eventually, they may be implemented directly into the Core
	* Widget authors should hook the existing function, if it's present (No Returns):
	  Ex.	local OriginalFunction = TidyPlatesGlobal_OnInitialize
		TidyPlatesGlobal_OnInitialize = function (extended)
			if not extended.widgets.mywidget then extended.widgets.mywidget = CreateFrame("Frame", nil, extended) end
			if OriginalFunction then OriginalFunction(extended) end
		end

6.9.5
---------------------------
- Core: Reversion of scale and alpha handling to 6.9.Beta3 (Removal of transition effects)

6.9.4
---------------------------
- I need coffee.  Now.

6.9.3
---------------------------
- Tapped Mobs now apparently have the color: 0.53, 053, 0.53.... so I've updated the core to properly ID tapped mobs
- Mousing over a nameplate will temporarily bring that frame to FrameLevel 1, which should help targeting in crowds.
- A few other little things that I can't recall now.  I need sleep!

6.9.2
---------------------------
- More bug fixing, which seems to be a blessing in disguise, since it's yeilding some removal of redundancies, and (hopefully) incremental improvement in performance.
- Hub: Added a new Filter Item, "Filter Mini-Mobs".  This'll allow you to scale and fade those pesky mobs with mini-nameplates.  70% works well for me.

6.9.1
---------------------------
- Fixed: Raid Icon Bug?  (Changed some stuff around to even further reduce the chance of an out-of-order plate styling.)
- Increased default rate of Alpha/Scale Transitions.  Can be changed via, TidyPlates:EnableFadeIn(FadeRate)
- Added some additional code to check for nil values in the Default Filter Function.
- Added Players to the "Filter" Hub Mode

Note: Threat Plates v6.008 is not completely compatible.  Please use Tidy Plates v6.8.3

6.9
---------------------------
- Core: Added Scale Transitions.  Disable via, TidyPlates:DisableFadeIn() or /tidyplates panel
- Core: Added full Alpha Transitions. Disable via, TidyPlates:DisableFadeIn() or /tidyplates panel
- Core: Added a Tidy Plates Panel checkbox to control the Scale/Alpha fade feature
- Core: New unit variable: unit.platetype = 1 or 2, where 1 = normal Blizzard nameplate, and 2 = mini nameplates (seen on 'drone' mobs, for example)
- Core: Added code to correct value '0' scale from delegate functions
- Core: The SetHealthbarColor delegate will now control the statusbar-backdrop color in addition to the healthbar color:
	- 1. The SetHealthbarColor delegate gradient has been deprecated (It accepted two rgb sets - r1,g1,b1,r2,g2,b2 - which corresponded to the endpoints of a gradient)
	- 2. SetHeatlhbarColor now accepts two rgba sets - r1, g1, b1, a1, r2, g2, b2, a2 - which define the healthbar color+alpha and the backdrop color+alpha, respectively.
- Core: Deprecated "SetStatusbarWidthMatching" flag
- Core: Deprecated "style.frame" - Blizz made some changes, rendering this option obsolete.
- Aura Widget: Added a check for destination name in the Aura Widget  (Fixes "AuraWidget.lua:658" error)
- Aura Widget: Fixed Default Prefilter Errors
- Aura Widget: 'TidyPlatesWidgets.SetAuraPrefilter(function) replaces 'TidyPlatesWidgets.SetDebuffPrefilter'
- Aura Widget: 'TidyPlatesWidgets.SetAuraFilter(function)' replaces the previous method of assigning the Filter into each Widget instance via 'wiget.Filter'
- Aura Widget: Filter function now accepts these return values:  [show, priority, r, g, b], where 'show' indicates that the aura should be displayed, 'priority' indicates
	how important the debuff is to display, and 'r',  'g', and 'b' indicate the vertex color of the border highlight.  This can be used to colorize auras for different
	schools or types.
- Aura Widget: Square/Small Auras will now terminate/expire properly, and call for a delegate update.
- Hub/Aura Widget: Added "Track Dispellable Debuffs on Friendly Units", which will allow you to track and highlight debuffs on friendly units that need to be dispelled.
	"Magic", "Poison", "Curse", or "Disease".  Have I tested it?  Hahahaha..he.. um, no.
- Hub/Aura Widget: Removed prefix, "No"; Useless in the current evolution of the Hub Filter system.
- Hub/Aura Widget: "CC" prefix will highlight the aura with a Yellow border
- Hub: Added Health/Optional Text Mode: By Arena ID. I have no clue if it works.
- Hub: Aura prefilter should work properly, instead of letting everything through
- Hub: Multi-Mode Functions will cross-check the table index, preventing out-of-range values from throwing errors.
- Hub: Removed/Replaced distinct "By Low Threat", "By High Threat", and similar Modes from Scale, Alpha, Name, and Color Spotlight functions.  THESE HAVE BEEN REPLACED by
	a single setting under the "Threat" Category, allowing you to control the Threat Mode for all Threat functions.
- Raid Tank/Target Watcher: Fixed Tanks.lua nil 'for' limit
- Raid Tank/Target Watcher: Fixed unitid/raidid issue.
- Raid Tank/Target Watcher: Added combat-log detection of melee attacks against non-tanks. (Untested)
- GroupCache: Fixed an issue where class color was not available for the last friendly raid member to join a team.  (Note: The GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE event is sometimes called
	before all the player data is available, leaving holes in the data table)

6.8.3
---------------------------
- Rogue Anticipation stacks are now displayed on the combo point widget
- AuraWidget.lua: Added some (currently inactive) code within aurawidget.lua for, "Personal Aura Tracker".  Feel free to mess with it.  Search for, "Personal Aura Tracker"
- AuraWidget.lua: Added some (currently inactive) code for highlighting abilities that can be activated.  Again, if you want to mess with it on your own, feel free.
- Made some changes to the Off-Tank Color feature; Enabling it will force detection of Off-Tanks, even if you are not a tank.  NOTE: There are still limitations inherent in the WoW-API which limits the ability of this feature to track all on-screen targets and target-ofs.

6.8.2
---------------------------
- TAPPED mobs now are a unit.reaction member
- Added "Filtered Unit Scale" to the Hub:Filter category
- Removed test code, which was accidentally causing Mages to get Priest coloring and Icon
- Support for Phanx's "Class Colors" addon, http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12513-ClassColors.html


6.8.1
---------------------------
- "Tapped" units (colored light purple by the Blizz nameplate system) will now register as "Hostile NPCs" in Tidy Plates.  This is partially inaccurate, since the tapped mobs could be neutral (like target dummies), but there is no way to discriminate this from the plate.
- Fixed several tainted global variables
- Added custom Monk and Priest color lookups for class recognition.  (RAID_CLASS_COLORS is not completely accurate)
- Changed the way the class colors are stored, hopefully fixing some other class ID problems
- Disable Tanks module by default.  Add option button to hub.
- Hopefully Fixed Off-Tank coloring issue.

6.8
---------------------------
- Updated to 5.1 ToC and new nameplate object configuration:

Nameplate Stack WoW 5.1:

Nameplate_Frame
	NameplateChild_Frame1_Statusbars
		Statusbars_Child_Frame1_Healthbar				(Statusbar)
		Statusbars_Child_Frame2_Castbar					(Statusbar)
		Statusbars_Region_Texture1_Threat				(Texture)
		Statusbars_Region_Texture2_HealthBarBorder		(Texture)
		...
		...
	NameplateChild_Frame1_UnitName
		UnitName_Region_Fontstring1_Name				(Fontstring)


6.7.9
---------------------------
- Corrected another error in the spell cast watcher; "StopCastAnimationOnNameplate" is now properly referenced.  This only affects arena matches.  I don't do arenas, so this was never properly tested.  Let me know if more errors pop up.

6.7.8
---------------------------
- Corrected a typo in the spell cast watcher; "StartCastAnimation" is now properly, "StartCastAnimationOnNameplate".  Arena fans rejoice!

6.7.7
---------------------------
- Fixed: Monk Tank mode (Stance of the Sturdy Ox stance added to the shapeshift list)
- Corrected various threat values coming into the threat line widget
- Core: extended plate verification process
- Removed many unneeded local variables
- Combed files for any "_" that could be global

6.7.6
---------------------------
- Added code to verify healthmax values.
- Sets framelevel to 0.  Targetted plates are raised to 1, which still does obscure the chatbox and minimap.  This also occurs with the standard Blizz nameplates, and cannot be corrected without raising the strata or level of those other frames.
- Added a rudimentary localization framework.  To use: Create an addon named, "TidyPlatesHubXX" where the XX is the last two letters of the localization code.  Ex. "TidyPlatesHubDE".  Within the code for that addon, create a table called, 'TidyPlatesHubLocalization', and add the translations.  For example:
TidyPlatesHubLocalization["Style"] = "Translation of STYLE".   See TidyPlatesHub\Lists.lua for an example.  Future versions will add a "Dump" mode for outputting all the text that needs translating.
- Changed the background, anchoring, and font sizes in the Hub, for readability.
- Changed the core template, and added a 'default' style, which looks like the Blizzard nameplates.  (will be useful in a future version)


6.7.5
---------------------------
- Removed framestrata code from, MinimapCluster, PlayerFrame, and TargetFrame
- Threat Line Widget:  Shootin' from the hip, again.

6.7.4
---------------------------
- Fixed giant threat bar issue (Corrected group size ranges in GetRelativeThreat() utility function)
- Raised MinimapCluster, PlayerFrame, and TargetFrame to "LOW" framestrata to prevent nameplates from obscuring those UI elements.
- Currently, there is no way to fix the brief 'flash' of the Blizzard nameplate art before it becomes active; It's a bug for the Blizz folks to solve.

6.7.3
---------------------------
- Removed debug code from GroupCache.lua (Chat log spam)


6.7.2
---------------------------
- Aura Widget: Fixed error, where certain auras filtered by spellid were not being displayed.
- Group Cache: Fixed updates for friendly group class colors (hopefully!)
- Group & Unit Cache: Will not try to search the global unit cache for class information while you are in a dungeon (could slow things down, and it isn't needed)
- Core: Reverted to earlier method of discriminating nameplates
- Threat Line Widget: Added some code to prevent it from accidentally becoming REALLY long.

6.7.1
---------------------------
- Fixed Range Widget bug

6.7
---------------------------
Beta9:
	- Upgraded the TOC file version number to 50001
	- Added: TidyPlates:EnableFadeIn() and TidyPlates:DisableFadeIn() functions, to control the nameplate fade-in mechanic.  Default is Enabled.

Beta8:
	- Removed debug console output

Beta7: r506
	- Added "Stance of the Sturdy Ox" to the Tank Aura list.  This should fix some "By Threat" oddities.
	- Added Monk specs to the HealerTrack widget.
	- Added PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD to Tank watcher events (to fix the line 39: nil errors)
	- (hopefully) fixed pauses while using the Arena mode with the Spell Cast Warning system

	- Jinx:
		- Right now, it looks like the debuff is applied by the server, not Your Character.  This is important because Tidy Plates ignores debuffs without a source.  In the beta, this debuff is properly displayed.

Beta6:
	- Capacitor Totem

Beta5:
	- Fixed: Bug where current theme selection would be lost when logging-in.

Beta4:
	- Added BUFFS to the aura widget.
	- Added texture coordinate function to tidyplates statusbar widget.  Usage/Example: healthbar.left = 0, healthbar.right = 1, healthbar.bottom = 0, healthbar.top = 1

Beta3:
	- The most visible change in Beta3 is the rearrangement of the Hub panel.  The debuff widget has been moved to its own category.
	- I've been working on a new way to control the health bar style.  I'm not sure when/if this code will become active.  I will probably post it as an alpha version after 6.7 is released.


Beta2:
What have I done so far?
	- Enhanced both the debuff widget and the spell cast warning module with support for Arena unitid event capture (via the standard event system, rather than the combat log).
	- Updated to MoP standards (which will work with 4.3, too)
		- Functions which have been renamed for MoP have been replaced by an internal function (provided by Tidy Plates) which is aware of the current client version, and will choose the appropriate function.
		- Tidy Plates now uses an internal button template, which replaces the UIPanelButtonTemplate2, which was removed in MoP



Testing
	- Need to test the Arena-Mode enhancements for the Debuff widget and Cast Warning system



Beta1 (r485)
	- Will do this later, too tired


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tidy Plates 6.6

6.6.2 (r465)
	- Fixed UnitCache Toolip 'nil' error

6.6.1 (r464)
	- Modified Unit Description Caching to work properly with addons that change the color of the tooltip text. (Like elvUI)
	- The Hub checks to see if the user has enabled any of the Aggro or 'By Threat' features, and automatically enables Blizz's Threat Warning feature. (which is required)

6.6.0
	- Under the "Style" category, all references to "Text-Only Plates" or "TextPlates" have been changed to "Headline Mode".  This change is intended to distinguish the style modifier from other references to "Text".  I'm sure some of you will hate this (can you come up with something better?), but I'm hoping that less cranky folks find the new grammar to be more intuitive.
	- To support the "Headline Mode" name change, I've added a new category.  Can you guess?  It's, "Headline".
	- I've grouped the "Color" and "Text" categories into "Color & Text", and moved them to the second-category position.  Why??  1: "Color & Text" controls the appearance of the default 'Health Bar' style.  2: Underneath, "Headline" controls the appearance of the 'No Bar' style.  Thus: This arrangement puts these options close to where the user selects the modes, in the "Style" category.
	- Square Debuff Icon Option: Added a new Debuff Widget option, "Debuff Style", which allows the user to select between the traditional "Wide" debuff format, or a more squareish "Compact" style.  The column count is increased to 5 for the "Compact" style.
	- Bookmark System: Added a "Bookmark" system to the Hub panels, which allows a user to jump directly to any of the categories
	- On certain themes, the position of your debuffs will be adjusted to allow the combo point widget to comfortably fit (on Rogues and Druids, only).  When the combo widget is disabled, the icons will "snug" themselves closer to the plate.
	- Using the '/hub' command will bring you to the Hub Configuration panel for your current theme
	- Added click sounds to the 'Copy' and 'Paste' buttons
	- Bug fixes and Memory optimization
	- Added a Prefilter option for the debuff widget cache
		* The hub enables the prefilter, when you're using the 'By Prefix" mode
		* Debuffs NOT on your list are not cached
		* This should save a ton of memory if you're using 'By Prefix'
	- Made some changes to the Unit Data Cache system to reduce memory use, and avoid certain 'lag' events...
		* Pet/Companion NPC titles are no longer cached
		* Cached unit guild and npc titles are now stored within the TidyPlatesWidgetData variable, keeping this data out of the base TidyPlates saved variables
		* Hub/Reset button will now clear the cached unit descriptions/titles and guilds
		* Unit descriptions (player guild name, or NPC role/title) will not be displayed while in an instance.  This is to avoid the CPU overhead that occurs when searching the database, which could be THOUSANDS of entries.  This is a direct cause for massive FPS drop, in some cases.
		* A side-effect of these changes is the clearing of user's stored guild names and NPC titles.  This is required to get the desired performance benefits.
	- Matched widget duration timer to default blizz interface standard (using 'floor' rather than 'ceil')
	- Fixed SpellId variable name in widgets\tank.lua
	- Spell Cast Monitor: If cast time is not greater than 0, make it a minimum of 1.5s
	- Added NameColorByEnemyClass
	- Minimize Hub now scale to 85%
	- Rearranged Name Color: By Friendly/Enemy class
	- Improved HealerTrack.lua, with help from Curseforge user, dakunesu.  Improves detection of healers in battlegrounds! Rockin!
	- Added a "Minimize" button to the /hub UI panel.  Clicking this will detach the Hub panel from the Interface Options window, and make it smaller.  Good for configuring stuff while playing.
	- The Copy & Paste buttons for the Hub panels now work with a unified Clipboard, so you can Copy & Paste between Tank and DPS panels.  Holding down "Shift" while clicking Copy or Paste will use the original Tank/DPS-specific caches.
	- New Hub Option: "Bring Casting Units to Spotlight Scale"
	- Unit Cache should filter out reputation names.  This fixes an issue occuring when "Colorblind" mode is active, causing Reputation to be displayed instead of an NPC's Title.
	- "Filter > Filter Inactive": When a unit is marked with a target/raid-icon, it's now assumed to be Active.
	- And more (ie. stuff I've forgotten about)

-----------------
6.4...

(r358)
- Added: Tip text next to Hub Debuff widget config

(r308)
- Debuff widget now uses single dimension tables to store cached data, to improve memory management
- Moved Widgets to their own addon/folder (For memory usage tracking)

6.3
-----------------

6.3.8 (r307)

	* Channeled spells now move the cast bar in reverse.
	* Friendly/Enemy "V-key" Automation; In Combat, Out of Combat, Always
	* Debuff widget now Caches texture of debuffs (to fix sunfire phenomenon, and similar)

6.1
-------------

		- ALL, MY, NO, OTHER, CC
		- Using CC will eventually highlight the debuff on the widget, but for now it just acts as "ALL"

	- Fixed UnitChannelInfo interruptable spell argument bug
	- Found a bug; The Editboxes contained in my ScrollFrames seem to invisibly extend past the bottom of the scrollframe, which can block underlying UI controls.  I've dropped the editboxes to a lower frame level, which is a hack method of preventing problems with it interferring with controls anchored to the bottom of the scrollframe.  Will attempt to figure out a better solution.
	- Name text coloring modes
	- By Raid Icon modes for Opacity and Scale

6.1.8 (r227)

	- Changed from thousand/million suffix for health text to using a thousands seperator
	- Restored PTR support (last time I checked)
	- Moved Quatre Raid Icon to similar position as Neon (to left side of health bar)

	- Added Events for UNIT_SPELLCAST_NOT_INTERRUPTIBLE, UNIT_SPELLCAST_INTERRUPTIBLE

	- WoW 4.1 Compatibility (should work on 4.0.x and 4.1, concurrently.  I have not tested on the PTR, though)



r199	- Raid Tank Coloring in Tank mode.  Automatically used when in "By Threat" Modes.

	- At this stage of development, If you can't figure out how to enable it on your own, YOU SHOULDN'T.
- Changed the update functions a wee bit to try and reduce CPU load.  Some plates may not be updating correctly.  Complain wisely (ie. with specifics) and it shall be fixed.
