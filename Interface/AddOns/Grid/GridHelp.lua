		"A unit is a specific player character or NPC. Grid shows frames for all group units, including your character, your pet, your party or raid members, and their pets.",
		"{Status}",
		"A status is a piece of information about a unit, such as how much health they have, whether they have aggro, or how many stacks of a particular debuff they have.",
		"{Indicator}",
		"An indicator is a part of the unit frame that can visually display a status, such as a health bar, a frame border, or a debuff icon.",
		"{Priority}",
		"Grid uses a priority system to let you show more information in less space. You can assign two statuses to the same indicator, and then when they're both active, only the one with the higher priority will be shown.",
		"For example, if you're a priest, you might assign Power Word: Shield (yellow, high priority) and Weakened Soul (red, low priority) to the Top Left Corner indicator. When you cast Power Word: Shield on a unit, you'll see a yellow square representing the shield buff. If the shield is consumed before the Weakened Soul effect ends, then you'll see a red square in the same place representing the Weakened Soul debuff.",
		"If your class can dispel both Magic and Poison debuffs, you might assign both Debuff Type: Magic (blue, high priority) and Debuff Type: Poison (green, low priority) to the Frame border indicator. When a unit has only one type of debuff, the frame border will be highlighted with the color for that debuff. If a unit has both types of debuffs, the frame border would be blue, showing the higher priority Magic debuff.",

Instead, the core addon tries to include the basic features everyone needs, and offer a simple plugin system so developers can easily add more features. Here is a short list of some popular plugins and companion addons you can find on Curse.com and/or WoWInterface.com.",
		"{Click casting} allows you to bind clicks to spells. For example, you could bind Shift-Click to cast Flash Heal. If you're interested in this functionality, we suggest {Clique} by Cladhaire as a great standalone addon that adds click-casting to all unit frames, including Grid.",
		"{Spell IDs} for telling apart different buffs or debuffs with the same name are not currently supported by the Grid core. We do plan to add this functionality in the future, but in the meantime, we recommend using the {GridStatusAurasExt} plugin by Adirelle.",
		"{Mana bars} are not included in Grid, as the developers feel they are not really useful for anyone, and a simple {Low Mana Alert} status meets the needs of raid leaders and the few classes who actually care about other players' mana, but without all the clutter of 40 extra bars on your screen!",
