	- Omega via svn r12223: Round that to 2nd decimal
	- Omega via svn r12222: More fixes
	- Omega via svn r12221: Another fix One more fix remains. figure out wtf it's sending as a timer cause the time makes no sense

	- Omega via svn r12219: more debug, and first round of fixes
	- Omega via svn r12218: Fix sending break timers in draenor
	- Omega via svn r12217: add some debug to figure out what is wrong with BTR
	- nbluewiz via svn r12216: # almost aoe spells not fires SPELL_PERIODIC_MISSED, use SPELL_ABSORBED instead.

	- Omega via svn r12212: Spam reduce
	- Omega via svn r12211: Fixes to last
	- Omega via svn r12210: Add balls counter, for mythic. MCs should be every second. because koragh likes two balls.
	- Omega via svn r12209: fixed bug where playerHasBranded was not recoverable. Added range frame for replicating Nova Improved range frame behavior for mark of chaos, combining it with branded was only confusing and made it unclear what target to run away from for mark of chaos. So removed combined nonsense.

	- nbluewiz via svn r12207: # little 5 man update.
	- Omega via svn r12206: Fix another error

	- ultrashining via svn r12201: zhTW update
	- nbluewiz via svn r12200: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r12199: ##Massive pass on core to micro optimize memory usage by fixing probably over 100 locations where DBM was used where self should have been ##Removed useless junk as well ##Made voice check smarter Initial tests show I didn't fuck anything up but mod needs some review after this one heh.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12198: # sound tweak. # koKR update.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12197: # fix error.
	- Omega via svn r12196: Better Version check
	- nbluewiz via svn r12195: # 5 man fix.
	- Omega via svn r12194: CN update
	- Omega via svn r12193: CN update
	- Omega via svn r12192: Fix last. Seems working. maybe not cleanest way to do it but it works, without breaking existing code or adding new args, since this basically injects (if present) VP version into displayVersion string
	- nbluewiz via svn r12191: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r12190: Send VP version info in string prune no longer needed VEM filters
	- Omega via svn r12189: enable voiceExpelMagicArcaneFel, voice is generated now., bump CheckVoicePackVersion to now require version 1 in voice packs for 6.0.10 release. Add X-DBM-Voice-Version: 1 to voice pack if it's 6.0.10 ready (has all sounds including expel magic: fel Aded special warning to go with voiceExpelMagicArcaneFel for everyone else.
	- Omega via svn r12188: raise antispam on target name on korgah for those melee that just keep stutter stepping before they realize they are target.
	- Omega via svn r12187: raise scan time on tectus just a little more, so it's sure to catch all 8 in most mythic strats
	- nbluewiz via svn r12186: # lfr frost orb timer fix.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12185: # big boom warn.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12184: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r12183: Add smart arrow that saves position when fel is applied, then points you back to it 5 seconds before debuff expire
	- Omega via svn r12182: More mythic margok, this time a special info frame that shows the targets affected by 176537 (closest to glimpse of madness)
	- Omega via svn r12181: Thanks to CN transcriptor logs, massive improvement to margok mythic
	- Omega via svn r12180: Oops, tweak
	- Omega via svn r12179: Thanks to kind sharer of kill log, phase 4 timers now. well except for first. since these were warcraftlogs of fight and those don't have phase transition yell to establish timeline for first casts. for that will need transcriptor or chatlog to verify.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12178: # terongor timer tweak.
	- ultrashining via svn r12177: zhTW update
	- nbluewiz via svn r12176: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r12175: Shorten Timer Text. nebula has a point, i'm actually not sure why i didn't do this sooner, i had already done it with warning text.
	- Omega via svn r12174: margok drycodes for mythic since guilds keep complaining about it (and yet won't provide logs). No promises it's even remotely functional since no decent logs. :\
	- nbluewiz via svn r12173: # Avoid duplicate target in combined show. # Skyreach range frame fix.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12172: # bad cid.
	- Omega via svn r12171: Balls forgot code
	- Omega via svn r12170: tweaks
	- nbluewiz via svn r12169: # Use sync for ball, but still have strange issue. (added comment for that)
	- nbluewiz via svn r12168: # iron docks fix.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12167: # switch to DBM:AddMsg
	- Omega via svn r12166: make the versioning easier to understand for voice packs. version 1 field, all files needed by dbm 6.0.9 present. Version 2, TBD, whenever more audio files are created and applied to mods that weren't present in 6.0.9.
	- ultrashining via svn r12165: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r12164: Fix nil
	- nbluewiz via svn r12163: # fix bug.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12162: # improve /dbm lockout display.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12161: # fix Xeritac bug.
	- Omega via svn r12160: Change tectus warning to shockwave, instead of watch wave. it's a frontal cone shockwave attack. Tweak kargath voice warning to play once for melee instead of both times. Melee smart to play on spell cast start. ranged, on success.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12159: # fix bug.
	- ultrashining via svn r12158: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r12157: Beyond all explanation. +21 is always 2 seconds short, so lets try +23!
	- nbluewiz via svn r12156: # fix health bug.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12155: # variables changed.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12154: # koKR update.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12153: # check voice option is enabled before mute spec warning sound.
	- Omega via svn r12152: default filter to off. i think it's users responsibility to set it up. on by default risks on for people that don't want it on or can't find it. people who do want it more likely to find it.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12151: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r12150: Oops, fix a bug with no sounds at all Fix lua errors on azzakel. Fix voice not cancel on ragewing Added warnings for nether energy. more, when i decipher more chinese.
	- Omega via svn r12149: MAYBE fix a nil error reported by tom_rus. impossible to tell since he sucks at reporting errors :P
	- Omega via svn r12148: Finalize last
	- Omega via svn r12147: Simple, done. Voice pack not match min requirement, filter disabled. no messy args or even more inflation to mod tables or unnecessary overhead. When new voices added to DBM mods, bump voice requirement version, voicepack not match, filter disables until voice pack updated with new support. Removed mistakes in my original code though (double checking needlessly)
	- Omega via svn r12146: I do not approve of nasty hack. reverting. this is EXACTLy what i said I do not want.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12145: # more smarter VoiceOverSW tweak.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12144: # voice version check.
	- Omega via svn r12143: Prep for sound.
	- Omega via svn r12142: Add under you warning for fel as well
	- Omega via svn r12141: More koragh improvement per requests.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12140: # koKR update.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12139: # Expel Magic: Fel yell.
	- Omega via svn r12138: Option text change, that actually doesn't require a UI reload anymore.
	- Omega via svn r12137: Increment alpha
	- Omega via svn r12134: This probably won't make tag but it's fine if it doesn't.
	- Omega via svn r12133: Commit balls fix
