Tagging as 6.0.5


--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number to 6.0.5
	- Omega via svn r11873: CN update
	- Omega via svn r11872: Advertise molten core mod if it's not installed (only once).
	- Omega via svn r11871: add a simple IsEvent check
	- Omega via svn r11870: Fix combat rez timer showing in Molten core, (well, all event5 and event40 dungeons actually).
	- nbluewiz via svn r11869: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r11868: fix lua error
	- ultrashining via svn r11867: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r11866: disable time to feed timer, it's quite wrong now. need more data to enable a new better one.
	- Omega via svn r11865: First flame slash is 5 seconds, not 8
	- Omega via svn r11864: Health based, no timer
	- Omega via svn r11863: more toc. not sure this will 100% work though
	- Omega via svn r11862: TOC Fix
	- Omega via svn r11861: First pass at dungeon fixes, I'm not going to list all of them in change log
	- Omega via svn r11860: use DBM:GetNumRealGroupMembers() for more accuracy in icons and rangeframe. Make sure to set map to current zone in the very last function in dbm that still uses mapIDs
	- ebmor via svn r11859: deDE update
	- Omega via svn r11858: Arrow no longer relies on map so no reason for this restriction
	- Omega via svn r11857: Text tweaks
	- Omega via svn r11856: I'm confident there is no loadmod bug, and it's all user error, this last debug will pretty much prove it in all cases
	- Omega via svn r11855: fix some screwups
	- Omega via svn r11854: Add fire ring challenge
	- nbluewiz via svn r11853: # koKR update.
	- ultrashining via svn r11852: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r11851: More Frame names
	- TOM_RUS via svn r11850: Add name to arrow frame
	- tandanu via svn r11849: and now we need some empty commits as I should have done the last commit in three different commits and not in one...
	- tandanu via svn r11848: svn server had a disk failure and crashed. that somehow corrupted the metadata for the last few commits (thanks, svn!)
	the simplest way to fix this seemed to be to apply the diffs for these commits by hand and remove the bad revision from the server
	
	here are the old commit messages:
	Log:
	Improve note, since I actually got not one but "two" bug reports about getting "taunt" warnings when not tank spec, when disabling this filter. Um that's the point?. An on by default filter and on by default taunt warnings allows tanks that very frequently switch between dps/tank to not have to worry about if they remembered to enable/disable the taunt alerts. They "just work". don't complain if you disable the filter and keep getting told to taunt the boss. :P
	
	Log:
	# clean.
	
	Log:
	Fix missing icon
